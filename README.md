## ‚úç Project Description 
Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE MRI) is a technique used to assess the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The parameter of interest, known as Ktrans, is typically estimated by fitting a mathematical model to the data acquired from serial T1-weighted images taken after the gadolinium injection. In our study, we have identified negative Ktrans values primarily attributed to filtering procedures applied by the MRI scanner. This project's core objective is to rectify these issues by learning the mapping between filtered and unfiltered data. We possess both filtered and unfiltered MRI data from the same acquisitions, which serves as the basis for our approach. To tackle this challenge, we would like to explore multiple avenues, including the possibility of training autoencoders or utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to map between filtered and unfiltered images.
